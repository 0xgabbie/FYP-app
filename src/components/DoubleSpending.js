        <h1>Understanding Double Spending</h1>
        <p>Double Spending as its name suggests is the expenditure of a digital currency twice, basically duplicating the money online. Because digital currencies are ultimately just files, a user can create multiple copies of the files in multiple places. </p>
        <br />
        <h1>How does Double Spending Happen?</h1>
        <p>Assume Merchant A and Merchant B:</p>
        <p>-A digital payment was made to Merchant A.</p>
        <p>-The copy of the transaction is stored on the userâ€™s computer.</p>
        <p>-Another digital payment was made to Merchant B using the same digital currency at the same time.</p>
        <p>-Both Merchants think that they have been paid but in reality the transaction has not been confirmed yet.</p>
